#Machine Learning Tools in Docker

![docker](http://blog.docker.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/KuDr42X_ITXghJhSInDZekNEF0jLt3NeVxtRye3tqco.png)

Machine learning tools are notorious for having byzantine dependencies and often academic code quality. This makes them hard to install and configure correctly across different machines and operating systems.  At  [Startup.ML](http://startup.ml/) we have been using Docker to simplify the process of getting these tools on our machines.

## Currently supported tools

* Deeplearning4j
* GraphLab
* H2O
* Julia
* MLlib
* Theano
* Torch7
* Vowpal Wabbit (VW)

## Getting started
### Step 0: Prerequisites for OSX
* First step is to [Install Docker on Mac OS X](https://github.com/boot2docker/osx-installer/releases/download/v1.4.1/Boot2Docker-1.4.1.pkg). 
* Once Boot2Docker has been installed, launch it from Spotlight
* In the terminal window with the title "Boot2Docker for OSX" go to the jetpack directory and start the build process (*be patient, the builds can take some time*)

### Step 1: For Linux and OSX
To build an individual image, provide it as an argument to the build.sh script. 

```
./build.sh julia (or theano, graphlab, h2o, mllib ...)
```

to run the docker image

```
./run.sh julia (or theano, graphlab, h2o, mllib ...)
```

# Troubleshooting

## Pulling Images

If you are having trouble with the build command, try the pre-built images

```
docker pull startupml/julia
docker pull startupml/theano
docker pull startupml/graphlab
docker pull startupml/h2o
docker pull startupml/mllib
...
```

## Starting Over

to clean up (kill, remove container and remove image)

```
./clean.sh 
```

## Linux specific

The docker daemon must run as root. To be able to run the docker
client as a normal user, add that user to the docker group. To do so
for the current user, run: `sudo gpasswd -a ${USER} docker`.
See [docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/#giving-non-root-access)
for more detail.
